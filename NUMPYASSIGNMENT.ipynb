    "### Theoretical Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose and advantages of numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "# NumPy (Numerical Python) is a fundamental package in Python that is widely used for scientific computing and data analysis. \n",
    "#It provides efficient tools for numerical operations, enabling faster computations and better handling of large datasets compared to Python's built-in data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Purpose of NumPy:\n",
    "# The primary purpose of NumPy is to provide support for:\n",
    "# 1. **Efficient Multi-Dimensional Arrays**: It offers a powerful N-dimensional array object (`ndarray`), which is a fast and flexible data structure for handling large datasets.\n",
    "# 2. **Mathematical Functions**: NumPy includes a wide range of mathematical and statistical functions that operate on arrays and matrices, making it easy to perform element-wise operations, matrix manipulations, linear algebra, and more.\n",
    "# 3. **Integration with C/C++ and Fortran**: It allows for easy integration with C, C++, and Fortran code, enabling high-performance computations and making it popular in scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Advantages of NumPy:\n",
    "# 1. **Efficient Memory Usage**: NumPy arrays (or `ndarray`) are more memory-efficient than Python's built-in lists. They use contiguous blocks of memory, making data storage and access more efficient.\n",
    "#   - Example: A NumPy array can store elements of the same type in a compact form, unlike Python lists, which store elements in a more generic, space-inefficient way.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Fast Computation**: NumPy is optimized for numerical operations. Element-wise operations on arrays are highly efficient because NumPy performs operations at the compiled C level rather than looping through elements in Python. This makes it much faster than using native Python loops for mathematical operations.\n",
    "#   - Example: Operations on NumPy arrays are 10–100 times faster than Python lists due to vectorized computations.\n",
    "   \n",
    "# 3. **Vectorization and Broadcasting**:\n",
    "#   - **Vectorization**: NumPy allows element-wise operations on entire arrays without needing explicit loops, thanks to vectorized operations. This greatly improves code performance and simplicity.\n",
    "#   - **Broadcasting**: NumPy supports broadcasting, which allows operations on arrays of different shapes in a way that would be impossible with standard Python structures.\n",
    "#   - Example: Adding a scalar to an array, or adding two arrays of different shapes, is handled automatically without needing explicit loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. **Rich Set of Mathematical Functions**: NumPy provides a rich collection of mathematical functions such as:\n",
    "#   - Linear algebra functions (`numpy.linalg`)\n",
    "#   - Statistical functions (`mean`, `median`, `std`, etc.)\n",
    "#   - Fourier transforms\n",
    "#   - Random number generation (`numpy.random`)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. **Handling Large Datasets**: NumPy efficiently handles large datasets by using arrays with a consistent data type, minimizing memory usage and allowing operations on large datasets that would be difficult or impossible using standard Python structures.\n",
    "   \n",
    "# 6. **Interoperability**: NumPy can interact with other libraries that rely on numerical arrays, such as SciPy, Pandas, and machine learning libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch. This interoperability makes it essential in data science, machine learning, and scientific computing workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. **Matrix and Linear Algebra Support**: NumPy has powerful tools for matrix operations, including matrix multiplication, determinants, eigenvalues, and other linear algebra tasks. These operations are fundamental to scientific computing and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How NumPy Enhances Python's Capabilities:\n",
    "# 1. **Array Manipulation**: Python's native lists are not optimized for numerical operations, especially when handling large datasets. NumPy enhances Python by providing `ndarray`, which is much faster for numerical tasks and supports multi-dimensional arrays, unlike Python lists.\n",
    "   \n",
    "# 2. **Vectorization and Elimination of Loops**: Python loops can be slow for large datasets, but NumPy’s vectorized operations allow you to perform complex operations on entire arrays without writing explicit loops.\n",
    "#   - Example: To add two arrays in Python, you might loop through each element, but with NumPy, you can simply use `array1 + array2`, which is much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **Advanced Mathematical Operations**: NumPy extends Python’s built-in capabilities with a vast array of mathematical and statistical functions, including those for linear algebra, matrix manipulations, and random number generation. These functions are optimized for performance and designed specifically for numerical computations."

    "# **1. `np.mean()`**\n",
    "# - **Purpose**: The `np.mean()` function computes the arithmetic mean (average) of elements in an array.\n",

    "  \n",
    "#  np.mean(a, axis=None, dtype=None, out=None, keepdims=False)\n",

    "# - **Returned Parameter**: The `returned=True` parameter, if set, returns a tuple with the computed average and the sum of the weights.\n",

For example, an array of `int32` uses 4 bytes per element, while an array of `float64` uses 8 bytes per element. By choosing the right data type, you can control how much memory is used.\n",

    "\n",
    "# **B. Performance Optimization**\n",
    "# - **Faster Computation**: Operations on NumPy arrays are faster than equivalent operations on Python lists, largely because NumPy arrays are stored in contiguous blocks of memory. The data type dictates how the memory is accessed and how operations are carried out.\n",
    "#  - **Smaller Data Types for Speed**: Using smaller data types like `int16` or `float32` allows computations to be performed faster because less memory is read/written during each operation, and CPU caches are used more effectively. However, this comes at the cost of precision.\n",

    "# **1. Vectorization**\n",
    "\n",
    "#**Definition**: \n",
    "#Vectorization refers to the practice of replacing explicit loops with array expressions. In NumPy, vectorized operations are implemented at a lower level (in C) and are optimized for performance, allowing for batch processing of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#**Benefits**:\n",
    "#- **Performance**: Vectorized operations execute much faster than traditional for-loops in Python, as they leverage optimized C and Fortran libraries under the hood.\n",
    "#- **Readability**: Code that uses vectorized operations is often more concise and easier to read, allowing users to express operations in a mathematical way.\n",
    "#- **Less Overhead**: By eliminating the need for explicit iteration, vectorization reduces the overhead associated with Python's loop mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#**Example of Vectorization**:\n",
    "\n",
    "# import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create two arrays\n",

    "# **2. Broadcasting**\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Definition**: \n",
    "# Broadcasting is a powerful feature that allows NumPy to perform arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes and sizes. \n",
    "# When two arrays are involved in an operation, NumPy automatically expands the smaller array to match the shape of the larger array, enabling element-wise operations without the need to manually adjust the shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **How It Works**:\n",
    "# - **Dimension Matching**: NumPy compares the shapes of the two arrays from the trailing dimensions. If the dimensions are equal or one of them is 1, broadcasting can occur.\n",
    "# - **Expansion**: If one array has a dimension of size 1, it is virtually expanded to match the size of the other array along that dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Benefits**:\n",
    "# - **Ease of Use**: Broadcasting simplifies the code, allowing users to perform operations on arrays of different shapes without requiring explicit reshaping.\n",
    "# - **Efficiency**: Broadcasting minimizes memory usage by avoiding the creation of large temporary arrays. Instead, it uses the original arrays, which can lead to more efficient computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Example of Broadcasting**:\n",
    "# Create a 1D array and a 2D array\n",
    "#a = np.array([1, 2, 3])      # Shape (3,)\n",
    "#b = np.array([[10], [20], [30]])  # Shape (3, 1)\n",

    "# [[11 12 13]\n",
    "# [21 22 23]\n",
    "# [31 32 33]]\n",
    "\n",
    "# In this example, the 1D array `a` is broadcast across the rows of the 2D array `b`, resulting in an array where each row of `b` has been added to `a`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **3. Contributions to Efficient Array Operations**\n",
    "\n",
    "# - **Elimination of Explicit Loops**: Both vectorization and broadcasting eliminate the need for explicit loops, which can be slow in Python. This leads to significant performance improvements, especially for large datasets.\n",
    "  \n",
    "# - **Reduced Memory Footprint**: Broadcasting avoids unnecessary duplication of data in memory, as it performs operations on the original arrays rather than creating additional copies.\n",
    "  \n",
    "# - **Enhanced Computational Speed**: Vectorized operations and broadcasting can be implemented using low-level optimized libraries (like BLAS and LAPACK), which execute operations much faster than Python-level loops.\n",
